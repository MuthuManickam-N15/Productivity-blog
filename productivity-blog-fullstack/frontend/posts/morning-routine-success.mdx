## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting too ambitiously**: Begin small and build gradually
2. **Checking phone immediately**: Wait at least 30 minutes
3. **Skipping breakfast**: Fuel your body properly
4. **Inconsistent timing**: Maintain the same schedule
5. **Not preparing the night before**: Set yourself up for success

## Tips for Success

### Night Before Preparation

- Lay out workout clothes
- Prepare breakfast items
- Set intentions for tomorrow
- Go to bed at a consistent time

### Start Small

Don't overhaul your entire morning at once. Add one new habit every 1-2 weeks.

### Track Your Progress

Use a habit tracker to:
- Monitor consistency
- Identify patterns
- Stay motivated

### Be Flexible

Life happens. If you miss a day, don't stress—just get back on track the next day.

## The 21-Day Challenge

Commit to your new morning routine for 21 days. Research suggests this is how long it takes to form a new habit.

**Week 1**: Focus on waking up at the same time
**Week 2**: Add movement and mindfulness
**Week 3**: Incorporate planning and learning

## Conclusion

A powerful morning routine isn't about doing everything—it's about doing what matters to YOU. Experiment, adjust, and find what works best for your lifestyle and goals.

Remember: The goal isn't perfection; it's progress. Start tomorrow morning and take the first step toward transforming your days.
